  Welcome to my thought process when it comes to setting goals.  Here you'll
  find a list of 30 goals I want to complete by the age of 30.

As you get older, you begin to understand yourself more:  your habits, values, interests and more. I‚Äôve come to the realization that I fear goals, specifically goals that are larger, require planning and small steps to accomplish. This is not because I don‚Äôt feel motivated to create them but more so that I‚Äôve been burned in the past.  Before, I would become extremely ambitious with a goal in mind but *zero* plan to back it.  Suddenly, the goal‚Äôs deadline arrives and I have nothing to show for it. This leaves me feeling defeated and dissatisfied with myself.

After my 29th birthday in early October of last year I started to reflect on the past year.  I felt proud of all that had been accomplished thus far but I knew there was still so much to do--so much I wanted to experience, learn and achieve.  So I thought, ‚ÄúWhat if I make a list of 30 goals that I can challenge myself with before the big 3-0?‚Äù  By the time early October of 2020 arrives, I can have each goal checked.  These goals can be related to lifestyle habits, starting new hobbies, trying something new and traveling.

To achieve goals, small or large, you need to be smart about them.  No but really, though.  [S.M.A.R.T.](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/smart-goal/)  Have you heard about it?



S - Specific

M - Measurable

A - Achievable

R - Relevant

T - Time Bound



In my personal journal, I dived deeper into each goal.  I asked myself why this specific goal was important to me and if it aligns with my life values.  Then I wrote about past experiences with each goal.  For example, take goal #26: Journal Once a Week.  I‚Äôve tried establishing this habit in the past but it didn‚Äôt stick.  I thought about why it‚Äôs important and how it will benefit me.  Then I wrote out a plan for the upcoming year that was realistic and manageable.  Lastly, I want to make these goals visible--thus, this post!  Have you ever heard of the saying, ‚ÄúOut of sight, out of mind.‚Äù?  Growing up, my mom used to say this to me *all* of the time and now I‚Äôm a believer of the phrase.  Thanks, mom! üëã  

Below you‚Äôll find my list of 30 by 30 goals.  I want to share this with you.  I want *you* to keep me accountable too.  I believe by putting this out in the universe, it will help me conquer this list.
