title: 30 by 30 Goals
description: 30 goals I want to complete by 30 years old.

As you get older, you begin to understand yourself more: your habits, values, interests and more. I’ve come to the realization that I fear goals, specifically goals that are much larger that require planning and small steps to accomplish. This is not because I don’t feel motivated to create them but more so that I’ve been burned in the past. I’ve become extremely ambitious with a goal in mind but zero plan to back it. Then suddenly the goal’s deadline arrives and I have nothing to show for it. This leaves me feeling defeated and dissatisfied with myself.

After my 29th birthday in early October of last year I started to reflect on the past year. I felt proud of all that had been accomplished thus far but I knew there was still so much to do--so much I wanted to experience, learn and achieve. So I thought, “What if I make a list of 30 goals that I can challenge myself with before the big 3-0?” By the time early October of 2020 arrives, I can have each goal checked. These goals can be related to lifestyle habits, starting new hobbies, trying something new and traveling.

To achieve goals, small or large, you need to be smart about them. No but really, though.  [S.M.A.R.T. ](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/smart-goal/)Have you heard about it?

S - Specific

M - Measurable

A - Achievable

R - Relevant

T - Time Bound

In my personal journal, I dived deeper into each goal. I asked myself why this specific goal was important to me and if it aligns with my life values. Then I wrote about past experiences with each goal. For example, take goal #26: Journal Once a Week. I’ve tried establishing this habit in the past but it didn’t stick. I thought about why it’s important to me and how it will benefit myself. Then I wrote out a plan for the upcoming year that was realistic and manageable. Lastly, I want to make these goals visible. Have you ever heard of the saying, “Out of sight, out of mind.”? My mom used to say this to me all of the time growing up and now I’m a believer of the phrase. Thanks, mom! \*wave emoji\*
